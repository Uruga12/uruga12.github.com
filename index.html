    <div class="phase_1">
      <h1 class="p_1_1">Legendaries</h1>
      <p>Creation of legendary BONEZ (owners of legendary NFTs will receive a significant advantage in the future). In addition, the rarity will not give any privileges/advantages.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="phase_1">

      <h1 class="p_1_1">Mint</h1>
      <p>(Will be held in whitelist mode, 1 token per wallet)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="phase_1">

      <h1 class="p_1_1">Launch on secondary marketplace</h1>
      <p>Magic Eden</p>
      </div>
      <div class="phase_1">

      <h1 class="p_1_1">DAO</h1>
      <p>Creation of a strong DAO including collaborations with other projects, a community alpha and possible community events.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="phase_1">
        
       <h1 class="p_1_1">BONEZ staking = "$SKLZ"</h1>
      <p>You will be able to put your skeletons in our crypt for 30 days, and receive from them tokens "$SKLZ", which will be used in our project actively, and will have a deflationary model (after use, it will be burned).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="phase_1">

      <h1 class="p_1_1">GEN 2</h1>
      <p>With our token it will be possible to acquire a baby version of the original collection, which will have the same functionality, only in a reduced form. The second generation will be placed on the secondary market as a separate collection.</p>

      <h1 class="p_1_1">Projects goal</h1>
      <p>Creating a platform to help launch other projects. We will take responsibility for the technical part. Launching projects will be done for a fee, which will be given to the community/for certain services. In our understanding, it is this aspect that will provide value to the project</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>What is our project about ?</dt>
      <dd>BONEZ is a semi-art/semi-utility project with main goal to provide our holders with profitable usage for people inside (and also outside) the community.</dd>

      <dt>What usage are we talking about ?</dt>
      <dd>Since NFTs became bigger and started to attract more attention, demand for pre-launch (such as Launchpad) and post-launch conditions (such as staking) began to rise extremely, we decided providing new projects with tools would be our main goal.
Right now thereâ€˜s only few projects, that are focusing on the exact same thing.</dd>

      <dt>Supply ?</dt>
      <dd>The initial supply will be 888. A second generation will be created in the near future in order to expand the community (after the completion of the entire roadmap).</dd>

      <dt>Price ?</dt>
      <dd>The price will be 1,11 SOL. Because of the current state of Solana, we think this is an affordable price for the majority. Additional funds will be needed for earlier mentioned services.</dd>

      <dt>Legitimacy of the project ?</dt>
      <dd>We understand and see how many projects look like at the moment and realize that people are skeptical about everything right now. It's an absolutely expected reaction. To prove that there is work behind all these words, we will keep you informed and show you the results of our work right up to the launch.</dd>

      <dt>Doxx ?</dt>
      <dd>In our opinion, doxxing is only necessary for projects, that are unable to provide evidence of the legitimacy of their promises. Since we are going to publicly announce/show our progress, doxxing is not necessary in this case. We would like to safe privacy, we hope you understand.</dd>
